This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What I would do further if this were to grow:

- Convert all files to TSX (including configs)
- allow users to set their resumes to private

## considerations to make
- [ ] [user experience is reasonable](design and layout) (design and layout)
- [ ] state transitions are encoded sanely ([xstate](xstate))
- [ ] data over the wire is validated ([yup](yup))
- [ ] interfaces between contract and frontend are enforced (typescript, typechain)
- [ ] contract is sane ([waffle tests](waffle tests))
- [ ] frontend is sane ([frontend tests](frontend tests))
- [ ] gas costs reasonable ([optimizations](optimizations))
- [ ] developer experience with tooling ([hardhat tasks](hardhat tasks))
- [ ] Readable and ready for other developers ([code style, comments](code style, comments))
