This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## challenges
- [IPFS and retrieving data](docs/IPFS challenges)
- [exhuastive-deps set in create-react-app](docs/exhuastive-deps set in create-react-app)

## considerations made
- user experience is reasonable ([design and layout](docs/design and layout))
- state transitions are sane ([xstate](docs/xstate))
- data over the wire is validated ([validation and yup](docs/validation and yup))
- interfaces between contract and frontend are enforced ([typescript and typechain](docs/typescript and typechain))
- contract is sane ([waffle tests](docs/waffle tests))
- frontend is sane ([frontend tests](docs/frontend tests))
- gas costs reasonable ([solidity optimizations](docs/solidity optimizations))
- developer experience with tooling ([hardhat tasks](docs/hardhat tasks))
- Readable and ready for other developers ([code style and docstrings](docs/code style and docstrings))

## What I would do further if this were to grow:

- Convert all files to TSX (including configs)
