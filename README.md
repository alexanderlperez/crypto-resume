This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## considerations made
- user experience is reasonable (design and layout)
- state transitions are sane (xstate)
- data over the wire is validated (yup)
- interfaces between contract and frontend are enforced (typescript)
- contract is sane (waffle tests)
- frontend is sane (frontend tests)
- gas costs reasonable (optimizations)
- developer experience with tooling (hardhat tasks)
- Readable and ready for other developers (code style, comments)

## What I would do further if this were to grow:

- Convert all files to TSX (including configs)
